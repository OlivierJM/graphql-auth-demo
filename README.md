# graphql-auth-demo

Created with CodeSandbox, the article that properly explains this is here https://medium.com/p/7f92e8120027

> This was created to demonstrate authentication in GraphQL.

- create a user
- authenticate the user
- generate and validate the token


**Used**

- apollo-server v2
- jsonwebtoken
- bcrypt
- pick(from lodash)
- mongoose

Althought this example uses mongoose and MongoDb, you can easily set up any other database.

**To-do**

- Use a different database (relational)
- Migrate to typescript
- Add more examples to show how relationships work in GraphQL
